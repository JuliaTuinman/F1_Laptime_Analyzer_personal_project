## Example Usage

```
=== F1 Lap Time Analyzer ===

Enter season (year, e.g., 2023): 2023
Enter race round number (1-23): 1

13. Dutch GP
14. Italian GP
15. Singapore GP
16. Japanese GP
17. Qatar GP
18. United States GP
19. Mexico City GP
20. São Paulo GP
21. Las Vegas GP
22. Abu Dhabi GP

**2024 Season:**

## Driver Numbers Reference

Common driver numbers you may need:
- 1: Max Verstappen
- 4: Lando Norris
- 11: Sergio Perez
- 14: Fernando Alonso
- 16: Charles Leclerc
- 44: Lewis Hamilton
- 55: Carlos Sainz
- 63: George Russell
- 81: Oscar Piastri

## Notes

- **Data Availability**: OpenF1 API has comprehensive data starting from 2023. Earlier seasons are not available.
- **Sector Times**: Sector time breakdowns are only available for races with timing data. Some races may only have lap times without sector splits.
- **Driver Numbers**: The application includes a basic driver name mapping. If a driver is not recognized, they will be displayed as "Driver #XX".

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements you could add:
- Add support for qualifying sessions and practice sessions
- Export results to CSV or JSON file
- Graphical visualization of lap times
- Driver championship standings
- Weather data correlation
- Tire compound analysis
- Cache API responses to reduce repeated calls

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: `ClassNotFoundException: org.json.JSONArray`
- **Solution**: Make sure you include the JSON library in your classpath when compiling and running

**Issue**: "Could not find session key for this race"
- **Solution**: Verify the season year and round number are correct. Data may not be available for very recent races or races before 2023.

**Issue**: "Sector data not available for one or both drivers"
- **Solution**: Some races may not have detailed sector timing data. Try a different race or use lap time analysis instead.
